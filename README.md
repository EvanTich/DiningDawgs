## How to access the database
Use a call to `https://dining-capacity.firebaseio.com/data.json` to get all the data from the database.

Call `https://dining-capacity.firebaseio.com/data/{hall}/{year}/{week #}/{day}.json` to get all the times and percents from that specific day.

E.g. `https://dining-capacity.firebaseio.com/data/bolton/2019/08/Friday.json` to get all the times and percents from that day.
